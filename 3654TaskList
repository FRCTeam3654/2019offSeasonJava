One left one right



Vocab:
    Commit - saving while saying specifically what you did
    Repo - on GitHub, merge the code so it knows which version of something you want to keep
    Branches - want working code on the main branch, use other branches for specific changes
    	Pull request - submitting individual branches to the captain for them to be merged accepted into the main/”blessed” branch


Limelight:
    Limelights transmit data to Network Tables at 100hz which is faster than the average at 10hz
    Limelight uses values like tv,  tx, ty, and ta 
        Tv - valid target 
        Tx - horizontal offset, used to turn robot
        Ty - vertical offset
        Ta - target area, can find distance between object and robot
